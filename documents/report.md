I started out watching some YouTube videos to get a better understanding of sass. I then clicked 
around the design system for a bit before I started making the screenshot. I began by making the 
container that contains the input fields and buttons, then I made the card shape. I made a card 
header that contains the small Finn-logo and Schibsted-logo.  After this I made the CSS for everything 
so far. I ran into some problems trying to get the placeholder text behave in the same way as on the 
live site, and due to time constraints I had to settle with a bit scuffed solution. After I was done with 
the card I made the little box to the left of it. 

All in all it was a remarkably painless process, and I don’t feel I encountered much coding problems 
except for the initial introduction to sass, and the placeholder text. I wasn’t able to save the icons 
from the design system page so I skipped the eye and the small ‘i’.


There was also a problem with no one joining my group on blackboard and GitHub, so I was unsure if I should make both the pages by myself or just do “my half”. I ran out of time but I think I did everything except screenshot1.
